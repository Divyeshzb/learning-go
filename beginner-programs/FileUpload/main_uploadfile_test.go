Scenario 1: Uploading a valid file

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check a happy path scenario where all the conditions are ideal - the request contains a well-formed multipart form file, the server can handle the file size, and the file can be written to the server. 
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the http.Request to include a form file of size smaller than 10MB. Mock os.Create and io.Copy functions to successfully create a file and write to it respectively.
    Act: Call uploadFile method with the mocked request and an http.ResponseWriter.
    Assert: Assert if the "Successfully Uploaded File\n" message was written to http.ResponseWriter. Check if os.Create and io.Copy were called with right parameters.
Validation:
    The method is supposed to return a success message after successfully writing the file to disk. The test checks this functionality by asserting if such a message was written. All happy path cases should pass this test. In relation to the business requirements, this test validates the file upload operation.

Scenario 2: Uploading a large file

Details:
    Description: The test is meant to check how the function behaves when the file size is larger than what it can handle.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the http.Request to include a form file of size larger than 10MB. 
    Act: Call uploadFile method with the mocked request and an http.ResponseWriter.
    Assert: Assert if the "Error Retrieving the File" message was written to console indicating an error occurred while parsing the form.
Validation:
    The method should return an error if the file size exceeds the maximum limit. The test checks this functionality by asserting if such a message was written. Constraints defined in the application should be tested and validated.

Scenario 3: Form file retrieval error

Details:
    Description: This test checks the functionality when there is an error retrieving the form file.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the http.Request object to not include a form file. Mock r.FormFile functionality to return an error.
    Act: Call uploadFile method with the mocked request and an http.ResponseWriter.
    Assert: Assert if the "Error Retrieving the File" message was written to console.
Validation:
    The method should return an error if the form file retrieval fails. This validates that the method handles error scenarios properly.

Scenario 4: File write error

Details:
    Description: The test is designed to check how the function behaves when there is an error writing the file to disk.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the http.Request to include a form file. Mock io.Copy to return an error while writing.
    Act: Call uploadFile method with the mocked request and an http.ResponseWriter.
    Assert: Verifying if http.StatusInternalServerError was returned.
Validation:
    The function is supposed to handle errors when there is a problem writing the file to the disk, and this test checks if that's happening properly. This is essential to make sure the function does not crash if such an error occurs.
