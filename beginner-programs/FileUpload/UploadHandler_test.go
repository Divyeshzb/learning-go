Scenario 1: Successfully processing of GET request

Details:
  Description: This test scenario will validate if the uploadHandler function can successfully handle a HTTP GET request.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new HTTP GET request. Mock the "display" function so it can accept the writer and string 'upload', and return a success response.
  Act: Call the uploadHandler function with the mocked request and a response writer.
  Assert: Assert that the HTTP response is successful and the "display" function was called with correct parameters.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the "display" function is correctly called when a GET request is sent to the uploadHandler. Success in this test validates the functionality of handling GET requests, a basic and regular feature of the implemented server.

Scenario 2: Successfully processing of POST request

Details:
  Description: This test will validate if the uploadHandler function can successfully handle a HTTP POST request.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new HTTP POST request. Mock the "uploadFile" function to accept writer and request, and return success response.
  Act: Call the uploadHandler function with the mocked request and a response writer.
  Assert: Assert that the HTTP response is successful and the "uploadFile" function was called.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the "uploadFile" function is correctly called when a POST request is sent to the uploadHandler. This is integral to the serverâ€™s functionality as this test validates if the server can handle file uploads, a crucial feature.

Scenario 3: Unhandled HTTP verb

Details:
  Description: This test scenario is meant to check the uploadHandler's response when an unhandled HTTP request method is used.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an HTTP request with an unhandled method such as "PUT". The "display" and "uploadFile" functions should not be set up in this scenario, as they should not be called.
  Act: Call the uploadHandler function with the unhandled request method and a response writer.
  Assert: Confirm "display" and "uploadFile" functions were not called.
Validation:
  This test confirms the implementation correctly ignores unhandled request methods. This validation is important because ignoring such requests ensures the server keeps running without unwanted crashes or responses.

Scenario 4: Handling of a faulty POST request

Details:
  Description: This test scenario is meant to check if the uploadHandler function can handle faulty POST requests correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new faulty HTTP POST request. The fault could be missing required fields.
  Act: Call the uploadHandler function with the faulty request and a response writer.
  Assert: Assert that the HTTP response is a bad request error (400 status code).
Validation:
  The assertion is expecting a bad request response because the function uploadFile should not be able to process faulty requests. Successful execution of this test confirms the robustness of the application by verifying it correctly handles erroneous situations. This is important to prevent crashes and undocumented behaviour.
