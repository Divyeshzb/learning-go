Scenario 1: Test HTTP GET Request Handling

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the function correctly handles incoming HTTP GET requests. We expect it to call the "display" function with the HTTP response writer and "upload" as arguments.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an HTTP GET request and a mock HTTP response writer.
  Act: Invoke 'uploadHandler' with the HTTP response writer and the GET request.
  Assert: Assert that the "display" function was called with the correct arguments (the HTTP response writer and "upload").
Validation:
  The choice of assertion verifies that the function correctly identifies and handles the HTTP GET request by passing the right arguments to the "display" function. This is essential to ensure that users attempting to upload files are presented with the correct user interface.

Scenario 2: Test HTTP POST Request Handling

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the function correctly handles incoming HTTP POST requests. We expect it to call the "uploadFile" function with the HTTP response writer and the request as arguments.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an HTTP POST request and a mock HTTP response writer.
  Act: Invoke 'uploadHandler' with the HTTP response writer and the POST request.
  Assert: Assert that the "uploadFile" function was called with the correct arguments - the HTTP response writer and the request.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion ensures the application processes the file upload requests correctly and directs them to the appropriate function for further processing. This is crucial to the upload feature's functionality.

Scenario 3: Test Unsupported HTTP Method Handling

Details:
  Description: This test should validate whether the function handles an unsupported HTTP method correctly. The expected behavior in such a scenario is not specified, and how to handle it is up to the programmer's discretion.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an HTTP PUT request (or any other method not handled by the function) and a mock HTTP response writer.
  Act: Invoke 'uploadHandler' with the HTTP response writer and the PUT request.
  Assert: Assert that neither "display" nor "uploadFile" functions were called.
Validation:
  This makes sure the app won't misbehave (e.g., trying to upload a file or showing the upload interface) when a request with an unsupported method is received. Given that the behavior isn't specified for unsupported methods, this asserts that the app refrains from executing any unpredictable behavior.
