Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/beginner-programs/Email-Validator/email_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

Scenario 1: Valid Email Test

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the email entered is valid and matches the characteristics of a normal email. It should return true as a valid email would pass the validation checks.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement of emails is needed as the simple invocation of the function on the go testing file would validate this, and emails can be defined directly.
  Act: Use IsValidEmail() function on a valid email.
  Assert: Use t.Errorf() of Go testing package to verify that the function return is true for a valid email.
Validation:
In this scenario, itÂ´s important to verify that the function validates an email that respects the regular rules. This is an essential part of testing because we want to ensure that any formatted email is recognized as valid.

Scenario 2: Invalid Email Test

Details:
Description: The purpose of this test is to check if the function rejects an invalid email as expected. This function should return false for an invalid email.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement of emails is needed as the simple invocation of the function on the go testing file would validate this.
  Act: Use IsValidEmail() on an invalid email.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns false for an invalid email.
Validation:
In this scenario, we need to make sure that the function correctly rejects invalid emails. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring reliable user communications.

Scenario 3: Null Email Test

Details:
Description: The aim of this test is to see if the email validation function is able to deal with null values or an empty string input.
Execution:
  Arrange: The go testing package automatically treats these as valid tests.
  Act: Apply the IsValidEmail() function to a null or empty email.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns false.
Validation:
In this scenario, we want to ensure that our function handles null or empty inputs correctly. Without this check, it would return misleading results with empty inputs, leading to possible bugs or system crashes.

Scenario 4: Long Email Test

Details:
Description: This test checks how the function handles emails that exceed the 255 character limit imposed by the email standard RFC.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an overly long email that violates the standard rules for testing.
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail() function with the above email.
  Assert: Assert that the function should return false.
Validation:
In this scenario, we verify whether the function follows the email standard rules by rejecting any email addresses that exceed the character limit. It's essential for maintaining compliance with email standards and preventing potential issues due to excessively long emails.
